DecisionTreeRulesGenInt32.cpp and DecisionTreeRulesGenDouble.cpp are two C source files used to generate rule files. They use the same framework and algorithm. The only difference between them is that the types of input arrays that are acceptable are different. Therefore, in the process of comparison, there is a slight difference in the type.

If you need to compile it, use the following command:
$clang++ -g DecisionTreeRulesGenInt32.cpp $(/usr/local/llvm-11.1.0/bin/llvm-config --cxxflags --ldflags --system-libs --libs core mcjit native orcjit) -rdynamic -O3 -o dtreeGen
OR
$clang++ -g DecisionTreeRulesGenDouble.cpp $(/usr/local/llvm-11.1.0/bin/llvm-config --cxxflags --ldflags --system-libs --libs core mcjit native orcjit) -rdynamic -O3 -o dtreeGen
(Please confirm and replace with the correct path of llvm@11.)

If you need to run this program, use the following command:
$./dtreeGen double_tree1.csv rule1 rule1.bc
(There are three parameters. The first parameter is the input CSV file. For its format, please refer to the CSV file given in the same directory. The first line is the correct and incorrect return values. Starting from the second row, the first column is where to compare. The second column is the value for comparison. The third column is the comparison relation or comparison symbol. The second parameter is the name of the Module. The third parameter is the name of the output file. This must be a .bc file)

After running, you can find the generated .bc file in the same directory and use the main program to test. At the same time, you can find the generated module information from the command line.

All the .bc files are generated by DecisionTreeRulesGenInt32.cpp or DecisionTreeRulesGenDouble.cpp.
